# xml-transcriptions
These XML files and transcriptions of Margaret Cavendish's works are painstakingly produced by the Digital Cavendish Project. Each document includes information regarding the transcription source and method of transcription. Users are free to download and use the XML data, but please give credit if our work is used.

Note: Unlike the EEBO-TCP Phase I texts, these texts are coded by hand by members of the Digital Cavendish Project. We will continue to encode texts not available under the EEBO-TCP Phase I project.
